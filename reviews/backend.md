# JavaScript Style

- Good JS style in backend code
- Good use of seed file
- Remove things.js

# Database

### Validations

+ Good use of validations, nice formatting of model files

### Schema Design

- Product
    + How are you planning to connect the reviews with the product
    + Consider adding methods so that it's easy in controllers to get a list of Products with Reviews
    + Price should be stored in cents, not decimal
- Order looks good, want to store the price in the Order as well as it's critical to not change prices on people's previous orders in your _products


# Node.js

### Routes

- Appear to be using standard routing generated by endpoint
- No authentication yet, what are plans for locking down Admin versus regular views?

### Controllers

- Appears standard generated.
- Product search by category and by term should consider moving that logic into the Product as a static method
    + What happens if multiple things are searched?  Can build up a query using multiple pieces of information and then exec
    
- Category - if you're going to store the Category names in the Products, then consider that you can't really let admins change the name UNLESS you also go and change all the product listings
